/** @brief A representation of a maze
 *
 *  @var origin A string indicating the author/source of the maze
 *  @var width The width of each row (<= MAZE_MAX_WIDTH)
 *  @var height The height of each column (<= MAZE_MAX_HEIGHT)
 *  @var maze An array of rows (strings).
 *
 *  Each even-numbered row (starting with the row at index 0) describes
 *  horizontal barriers.  In these rows:
 *  '-' is a horiontal wall. These may appear only at odd indices.
 *  ' ' indicates that the space may be freely moved *through*, but not *to*.
 *      These may appear only at even indices.
 *  '+' is the edge of a wall. These may appear only at even indices.
 *
 *  Each odd-numbered row (starting with the row at index 1) describes
 *  vertical barriers and playable spaces.  In these rows:
 *  '|' is a vertical wall.  These may appear only at even indices in the row.
 *  ' ' indicates that the space may be freely moved *through*, but not *to*.
 *      These may appear only at even indices.
 *  '.' is a free space which may be moved *to*. These may appear only at
 *      odd indices.
 *  '@', 'V', 'H' are the player, the flu virus, and the exit respectively.
 *      These may appear only at odd indices in the row.
