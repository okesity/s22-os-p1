"Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?"

This is a bare-machine-kernel version of the venerable "Colossal
Cave Adventure" game.  Developed in the late 1970's by Will Crowther
and Don Woods as ADVENT, a FORTRAN program running on PDP-10 machines
(which had 36-bit words!), it was later ported to C and Unix by
Jim Gillogly.  It is arguably the first work of interactive fiction,

This code base derives from DragonFlyBSD's games/adventure:

  git://git.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git
  commit a4c676668c3db6fb70e69bab092576a9bd1ef054

...and was ported to the 15-410 P1 build environment by Cyrus Bomi
Daruwala in February of 2021.

PLEASE NOTE: while you are free to distribute the code in this
directory (all by itself), you probably shouldn't:  pretty much
all modern Unix-like systems, which at the time of this writing
includes Linux, have an existing package which will enable you
to play Adventure.  Meanwhile, you should NOT be distributing
code containing both this Adventure code and P1 device drivers
you wrote, because that would be an academic integrity violation.

Finally, most people who want to hack on Adventure should probably
start from the DragonFlyBSD code rather than this code, because
some of the hacking done to get it to build in our environment
is useful rather than tasteful.  Furthermore, most people working
on interactive fiction these days write in a domain-specific
higher-level language, see, e.g.:
